# The Functional Approach to Programming

I am reading [this book](http://pauillac.inria.fr/cousineau-mauny/) by Guy Cousineau and Michel Mauny. It was written for the Caml Light dialect. I am converting the code to something that works with Ocaml 4.03.0. I will try and work on solutions to the exercises in parallel.

Note: I am more interested in the "global picture" of how one approaches problems with a functional mindset than in the details of the Ocaml syntax.
