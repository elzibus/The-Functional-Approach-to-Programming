# The Functional Approach to Programming

I am reading [this book](http://pauillac.inria.fr/cousineau-mauny/) by Guy Cousineau and Michel Mauny. It was written in the Caml Light dialect. I am converting the code to something that works with Ocaml 4.03.0 and I will work on solutions to the exercises in parallel.
